## Setting up React

-   Folder for components, sectioning, and views
-   Create Header, Main and Footer into the sectioning folder
-   Import those sections into the app.js like 'import Header from "./sectioning'
-   Install React Router Dom
-   Import it in your entry point "index.js" and wrap the application in a <BrowserRouter>
-   Use NavLink in Header (in sectioning )
    -   make sure to import the navLink from react-router-dom
    -   <NavLink to='/'> Home </NavLink> but you don't have to use the / in the name routes
    -   Change your styling to Flexbox
-   in Main from sectioning we need:
    -   import Routes and Route from react-router-dom
    -   <Route path='/' element{Landing} /> Landing lives into the views folder
-   Make a index.js in the views folder
-   import all of the view pages "landing,about,etc' from the Routher
-   export them in a named export
-   inside of main.jsx we and import that index.js in views as named imports in one link and the from would just be from views.
-   views are the nav items that can be clicked
-   sectioning holds the pages sections 'header, main, footer'
-   components can be used into more than one view or just one view examples a login or registation and a modal
